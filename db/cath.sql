This means that if you have a certain kind of student loan and have been through bankruptcy since 2005, you should not be repaying that debt and should not be subject to harassment by creditors.\n\nHowever, for some borrowers, lenders and debt collectors still try to collect illegally on certain types of student loans that were otherwise discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nThe types of student loan that is dischargeable in bankruptcy is one that is (i) made by a private, for-profit lender, and (ii) that is not for “qualified educational expenses” – meaning that the funds were not used for a traditional four year college. Loan for traditional four-year colleges are generally non-dischargeable.\n\nIn addition, if you received a student loan check directly in the mail, rather than through the school’s financial aid office, that loan may not have been for “qualified educational expenses” and so may be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nIf you have suffered from student loan debt collection efforts after you have filed for bankruptcy with a private, non-qualified student loan, you may have legal remedies to stop these illegal collection efforts.','\n	<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n		<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n			<h4>Examples of Student Loans That Can Be Discharged in Bankruptcy</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private student loans that may be dischargeable in bankruptcy include the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airline Training School Student Loans</span></li>\n<li>Flight Schools Student Loans</li>\n<li>Tractor Trailer School Student Loans</li>\n<li>Career Training Loans</li>\n<li>Culinary School Loans</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bar Exam Loans</span></li>\n<li>Study Abroad Loans</li>\n<li>Caribbean/Foreign Medical School Loans</li>\n<li>Computer Training School Loans</li>\n<li>Cosmetology School Loans</li>\n<li>Paralegal School Loans</li>\n<li>Non-accredited Law School Loans</li>\n<li>Heavy Equipment Operation School Loans</li>\n<li>Tutoring Loans</li>\n<li>K-12 Student Loans</li>\n<li>Prep School Student Loans</li>\n<li>Medical Billing School Loans</li>\n<li>Art School Loans</li>\n<li>Continuing Education Student Loans</li>\n<li>Fitness School Loans</li>\n<li>Holistic Health School Loans</li>\n<li>Mechanic School Loans</li>\n<li>Non-accredited Medical School Loans</li>\n<li>Medical School Residency Loans</li>\n<li>Technical College Loans</li>\n<li>Religious School Loans</li>\n<li>Online Education School Loans</li>\n<li>Any other educational program that did not offer federal student loans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n		</div>\n	</div>\n<div class=\"vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_grey\"><span class=\"vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l\"><span class=\"vc_sep_line\"></span></span><span class=\"vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r\"><span class=\"vc_sep_line\"></span></span>\n</div>\n	<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n		<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n			<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private Student Loan Debtors Facing Illegal Collection Attempts Have Legal Rights</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our investigation has revealed that hundreds if not thousands of student loan debtors may have suffered from illegal student loan debt collection efforts after their bankruptcy.

Although debt collection is perfectly legal, the FDCPA has established rules for the collection of consumer debts and provides protections to debtors by enabling them to challenge creditors and determine the validity and accuracy of asserted debts. Despite these debt collection laws, many debt collectors reportedly engage in illegal conduct in an attempt to collect on debts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is anyone who regularly collects debts that are owed to others, including debt collection agencies, companies that purchase and attempt to collect on delinquent debts, and debt collection lawyers who help companies who help creditors, debt buyers, or even debt collection firms.

According to FDCPA lawsuits, creditors use a number of illegal debt collection practices, including misrepresenting the amount that is owed, attempting to collect a debt that is not owed, falsely representing they are debt attorneys or government representatives, and sending out misleading correspondence that appears to be a legal document even though it isn’t.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Collection of Debts Not Owed:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Debt collectors are generally prohibited from collecting debts that are not owed by the debtor.

Although debt collection is perfectly legal, the FDCPA has established rules for the collection of consumer debts and provides protections to debtors by enabling them to challenge creditors and determine the validity and accuracy of asserted debts. Despite these debt collection laws, many debt collectors reportedly engage in illegal conduct in an attempt to collect on debts.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is anyone who regularly collects debts that are owed to others, including debt collection agencies, companies that purchase and attempt to collect on delinquent debts, and debt collection lawyers who help companies who help creditors, debt buyers, or even debt collection firms. Many states have enacted their own state versions of the FDCPA that apply to and regulate not only debt collectors but also creditors, including banks, credit card companies, etc.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a debt collector is found to have violated the FDCPA, the debtor may receive $1,000 in statutory damages, plus any actual damages that they have suffered.</span></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair and Illegal Debt Collection Practices for Private Student Loans</span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debt collectors who collect on student loans sometimes engage in various illegal collection practices when trying to collect a student loan debt: These types of illegal debt collection attempts can include the following:</span></p>\n <ul>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Debt Collection Harassment:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few exceptions, debt collectors are prohibited from contacting consumers who have notified them in writing to cease communication.

Although debt collection is perfectly legal, the FDCPA has established rules for the collection of consumer debts and provides protections to debtors by enabling them to challenge creditors and determine the validity and accuracy of asserted debts. Despite these debt collection laws, many debt collectors reportedly engage in illegal conduct in an attempt to collect on debts.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is anyone who regularly collects debts that are owed to others, including debt collection agencies, companies that purchase and attempt to collect on delinquent debts, and debt collection lawyers who help companies who help creditors, debt buyers, or even debt collection firms. Many states have enacted their own state versions of the FDCPA that apply to and regulate not only debt collectors but also creditors, including banks, credit card companies, etc.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a debt collector is found to have violated the FDCPA, the debtor may receive $1,000 in statutory damages, plus any actual damages that they have suffered.</span></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair and Illegal Debt Collection Practices for Private Student Loans</span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debt collectors who collect on student loans sometimes engage in various illegal collection practices when trying to collect a student loan debt: These types of illegal debt collection attempts can include the following:</span></p>\n <ul>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Debt Collection Harassment:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few exceptions, debt collectors are prohibited from contacting consumers who have notified them in writing to cease communication.

Although debt collection is perfectly legal, the FDCPA has established rules for the collection of consumer debts and provides protections to debtors by enabling them to challenge creditors and determine the validity and accuracy of asserted debts. Despite these debt collection laws, many debt collectors reportedly engage in illegal conduct in an attempt to collect on debts.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is anyone who regularly collects debts that are owed to others, including debt collection agencies, companies that purchase and attempt to collect on delinquent debts, and debt collection lawyers who help companies who help creditors, debt buyers, or even debt collection firms. Many states have enacted their own state versions of the FDCPA that apply to and regulate not only debt collectors but also creditors, including banks, credit card companies, etc.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a debt collector is found to have violated the FDCPA, the debtor may receive $1,000 in statutory damages, plus any actual damages that they have suffered.</span></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair and Illegal Debt Collection Practices for Private Student Loans</span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debt collectors who collect on student loans sometimes engage in various illegal collection practices when trying to collect a student loan debt: These types of illegal debt collection attempts can include the following:</span></p>\n <ul>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Debt Collection Harassment:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few exceptions, debt collectors are prohibited from contacting consumers who have notified them in writing to cease communication.

What these debtors may not know is that they have legal rights.</span></p>\n <p>If a lender or debt collector has continued to attempt to collect on a private student loan after you filed for bankruptcy, you may have a legal claim and could be owed compensation for violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) or through pursuing a bankruptcy discharge order violation. <strong>Get help now by filling out the form on this page for a FREE case evaluation by a consumer debt lawyer.</strong></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4>Student Loan Debtor Rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)?</h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FDCPA was passed by Congress in 1978 to combat the unfair debt collection practices used by many creditors and debt collectors. Although debt collection is perfectly legal, the FDCPA has established rules for the collection of consumer debts and provides protections to debtors by enabling them to challenge creditors and determine the validity and accuracy of asserted debts. Despite these debt collection laws, many debt collectors reportedly engage in illegal conduct in an attempt to collect on debts.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is anyone who regularly collects debts that are owed to others, including debt collection agencies, companies that purchase and attempt to collect on delinquent debts, and debt collection lawyers who help companies who help creditors, debt buyers, or even debt collection firms. Many states have enacted their own state versions of the FDCPA that apply to and regulate not only debt collectors but also creditors, including banks, credit card companies, etc.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a debt collector is found to have violated the FDCPA, the debtor may receive $1,000 in statutory damages, plus any actual damages that they have suffered.</span></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair and Illegal Debt Collection Practices for Private Student Loans</span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debt collectors who collect on student loans sometimes engage in various illegal collection practices when trying to collect a student loan debt: These types of illegal debt collection attempts can include the following:</span></p>\n <ul>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Debt Collection Harassment:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few exceptions, debt collectors are prohibited from contacting consumers who have notified them in writing to cease communication. However, debt collectors often ignore these consumer protection laws and continue to repeatedly contact consumers, even if they have told the debt collector or creditor to stop contacting them. Debt collectors are also generally prohibited from using threats and abusive language.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Telephone Harassment:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Debt collectors are only allowed to contact debtors between the hours of 8:00am and 9:00pm. Telephone calls outside of that time period are prohibited. In addition, debt collectors cannot cause the telephone to ring repeatedly or continuously: with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass a debtor. </span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>False Statements and Deceptive Practices</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:</strong> Under the FDCPA, debt collectors may not use deception to collect on a debt. According to FDCPA lawsuits, creditors use a number of illegal debt collection practices, including misrepresenting the amount that is owed, attempting to collect a debt that is not owed, falsely representing they are debt attorneys or government representatives, and sending out misleading correspondence that appears to be a legal document even though it isn’t.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Collection of Debts Not Owed:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Debt collectors are generally prohibited from collecting debts that are not owed by the debtor. This could be because the debt was discharged in bankruptcy or previously settled by the debtor. In some cases (such as identify theft), the debt may never have been owed by the debtor in the first place. </span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Collection of Expired Debts:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Debt collectors are generally prohibited from collecting debts that have been in default for more than four years. However, some creditors illegally attempt to collect time-barred debts by failing to disclose that the debts may have expired and threatening litigation.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Making Improper Reports to Credit Reporting Agencies:</strong> The<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> FDCPA determines what types of information that debt collectors and creditors must and must not report to credit reporting agencies. Despite these stringent regulations, many lenders report post-foreclosure deficiencies as debts, even though they have no right to collect on them. In another situation, debt collectors unlawfully fail to notify the credit reporting agencies that a debtor has already disputed a debt.</span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Failure to Cease Communication Upon Request:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Debt collectors generally must cease communications with a debtor who makes a written request that they no longer wish to receive any communications about the debt. Communications after a debtors written cease and desist request may violate the FDCPA. </span></li>\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Improper Communication with Third Parties:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some lenders reportedly violate the FDCPA by contacting a debtor’s family members, employers, or other people in connection with collecting a debt.</span></li>\n </ul>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bankruptcy Discharge Violations for Collecting on Private Student Loan Debt After Bankruptcy</span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bankruptcy is supposed to shield borrowers from future attempts to collect on a discharged debt. &nbsp;As a result, both lenders and debt collectors may be held liable for willful violations of the bankruptcy discharge order if they attempt to collect a private, non-qualified student loan after a borrower’s bankruptcy. </span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student loan debtors who have suffered from collection attempts after bankruptcy may be able to bring claims against a lender or a debt collector in bankruptcy court for actual damages that they have suffered, as well as punitive damages to punish them for willful violations of the bankruptcy discharge order.</span></p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\n <h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Legal Rights for Illegal Private Student Loan Debt Collection Efforts After Bankruptcy </span></h4>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have suffered from illegal private student loan debt collection efforts after you have filed for bankruptcy, or have endured other unfair or illegal debt collection practices regarding your student loan, get help now by filling out the form on this page for a FREE case evaluation by a student loan lawyer.
