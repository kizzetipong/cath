          Some legal experts seem to agree, as a recent motion to dismiss an Uber driver class action lawsuit was denied by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen. Judge Chen stated “Uber would not be a viable business entity without its drivers…. Uber’s revenues do not depend on the distribution of its software, but on the generation of rides by its drivers.”</p>

          Furthermore Uber recently agreed to a massive proposed wage and hour settlement concerning 385,000 drivers, with company agreeing to pay $84 million to the plaintiffs. However a number of plaintiffs are not satisfied with the arrangement, opting to reject the proposed settlement. These plaintiffs are concerned the amount of the Uber settlement will not be enough to justly satisfy each of the drivers, who incurred expenses as Uber drivers and were denied employment benefits.</p>
